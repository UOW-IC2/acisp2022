<center><h3>Title: Combinatorial Cryptography</h3></center>
          <p><b>Abstract:</b> Combinatorics has been playing an active role in cryptography, from the designs of cryptographic constructions, security proofs to cryptanalysis. Combinatorial cryptography refers to a sub-field of cryptography where combinatorics and cryptography are interacted significantly.  In this talk, I will present several concrete examples to illustrate how combinatorial objects and techniques are applied to the constructions of cryptographic schemes such as in secret sharing, threshold cryptography and secure multiparty computation.</p>

He has been with Nanyang Technological University in Singapore since 2006, where he served as the Head of Division of Mathematical Sciences from 2013 to 2015. Currently he is also the deputy director of the university researcher centre: Strategic Centre for Research in Privacy-Preserving Technologies & Systems (SCRIPTS) funded by the National Research Foundation of Singapore.

<center><h3>Title: Technical Challenges in Blockchains</h3></center>
          <p><b>Abstract:</b> In the past decade blockchain technology has attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry. It is the technology of choice to realize decentralized ledgers that are transparent, autonomous, and tamperproof. It reduces the dependence on intermediaries and introduces a new trust structure in transaction systems, so that entities from all over the world can transact directly.</p>
<p>The development of blockchains has been enabled by and has in turn triggered research in many fields such as distributed computation, cryptography, and programming languages, just to name a few. In this talk I’ll discuss several important technical challenges and research topics brought up by blockchains.</p>
          <p><b>Bio:</b> Jing Chen is Chief Scientist and Head of Theory Research at Algorand. Her main research interests are distributed ledgers, smart contracts, game theory, mechanism design, and algorithms. Previously, she was a faculty member in the Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University and an affiliated faculty member in the Economics Department. Jing received her bachelor's and master’s degrees in computer science from Tsinghua University, and her PhD in computer science from MIT. She received the NSF CAREER Award in 2016.</p>

         <center><h3>Title: Just About Time</h3></center>
          <p><b>Abstract:</b> When multiple programs execute on the same computer, they share the use of the microarchitectural resources. Because program execution affects the state of the microarchitecture and the state of the architecture affects program execution time, measuring execution time can reveal information on the state of the microarchitecture, and with it on prior execution of other programs. Thus, such micoroarchitectural timing attacks leak information by measuring variations in program execution time. </p>
		  <p>As these attacks often measure minute variations, at the order of few nanoseconds, multiple proposed defences aim at depriving attackers of high-resolution clocks. In response, counter-proposals that show how to overcome these defences have been published. In this talk we look at the ensuing armed-race and explore techniques for limiting timer resolution and for carrying out attacks with restricted timers. We will take a close look at the impact of low-resolution clocks on microarchitectural attacks, explore techniques for amplifying signals by over six orders of magnitude, and demonstrate how attackers can perform high-frequency, high-resolution attacks without using high-resolution clocks.</p>

          <p><b>Bio:</b> Yuval Yarom is an Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science at the University of Adelaide. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Adelaide in 2014, and an M.Sc. in Computer Science and a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1993 and 1990, respectively. In between he has been the Vice President of Research in Memco Software and a co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Girafa.com.</p>
		  <p>Yuval's research explores the security of the interface between the software and the hardware. In particular, he is interested in the discrepancy between the way that programmers think about software execution and the concrete execution in modern processors. He works on identifying micro-architectural vulnerabilities, and on exploitation and mitigation techniques.</p>

         <center><h3>Title: Security and Privacy Challenges in Edge Computing</h3></center>
          <p>Abstract: Applications utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly generating huge amounts of data. In order to effectively analyze the vast quantities of data generated by these devices, it becomes imperative to build scalable, distributed systems that can respond to this data management and analysis challenge. Performing all computations at a cloud data center has shortcomings, as it places a heavy load on the cloud infrastructure. This can cause response time delays to user applications. This delay may be acceptable for applications such as web browsing, for others such as interactive gaming, this delay could be unacceptable. This is where edge computing devices could play a role. If some of the computation could be performed close to the user(s) at the network edge, the response times could greatly improve. Edge computing extends a traditional cloud data centre model often by using a microdata centre at the network edge for computation and storage. As these edge devices are in proximity to users, this results in improved application response times and reduces load on the cloud data center. However, edge computing brings its own challenges in terms of security and privacy. This talk will share some of the key privacy and security challenges in developing and deploying applications at the network edge.</p>
          <p>Bio: Dr Surya Nepal is a Principal Research Scientist at CSIRO Data61 and leads the distributed systems security research group comprising 10+ staff and 40+ PhD students. He has been with CSIRO since 2000. Over the last 17 years, his main research focus has been in the development and implementation of technologies in the area of distributed systems (including cloud, IoT and edge computing) and social networks, with a specific focus on security, privacy and trust. He obtained his BE from National Institute of Technology (NIT) Surat, India; ME from Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Thailand; and PhD from RMIT University, Australia. He has more than 200 peer-reviewed publications to his credit; his papers are published in international journals such as IEEE Trans. Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Trans. on Service Computing, ACM Trans. on Internet Technologies, and IEEE Trans. on Computers. He has co-edited three books including security, privacy and trust in cloud systems by Springer, and co-invented 3 patents. He currently serves as an associate editor in an editorial board of IEEE Transactions on Service Computing.</p>
